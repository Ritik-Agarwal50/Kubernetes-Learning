What are Pods?
 -> Pods are similar to containers in docker. Pods are the smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model you create or deploy. A Pod represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster and can contain
    one or more containers.

-> A Deployment in Kubernetes is a higher-level abstraction that manages the creation, scaling, and updating of pods. Deployments provide declarative for pods and replica sets, enabling robust and controlled application deployments and 
management. 

Key Features:-
  1. Declarative Updates
  2. Scaling
  3. Self Healing
  4. Versioning
  5. Rolling Updates
